So friends, all the hard work has finally paid off. And now I have got a placement offer from **Royal Bank of Scotland (RBS)**.

About an year before, I wasn't eligible to sit for companies that came to recruit summer interns, because somehow I had managed to score a backlog in the 3rd semester of my college. It was only after I cleared the back in 5th semester, I was allowed to sit for the companies which came to our college in 6th semester (which weren't much as the placement season begins in the odd semester). Now as it is evident from the title, RBS was the first company that I appeared for, which came to our college in the month of February this year. Although I did manage to qualify for the final rounds at RBS office (in Gurgaon), I couldn't bag the internship opportunity. Now, a week before, RBS came to recruit again, this time for a permanent position at their campuses. And the rest is history!

While I am at it, I would like to thank a few people who have helped me achieve this feat. First of all I'd like to thank my parents and my brother, for everything that they have done for me. There are no words "golden" enough to describe their part in this. Then, there comes the part that my friends played. This is going to be a long list, so I'll try to mention only a particular few of them. 

* I'll begin with the friends I often hang out with. These are Abhinn, Armaan, Anurag, Anshul, Ankita, Nisha and Abhishek (a.k.a Damru). These people are the ones who have always been with me right from the beginning.
* Then, my old PGmates Shrey, Tanmay, Rahul, Swetank and Shubham Dokania. Shubham has been like my mentor for the best in class guidance he gives about various technologies.
* I would also like to thank Shreya Kashyap, Aditya Agrawal, Shefali, Pallavi and Neha Verma. These probably are the only ones that I like to talk to when I am feeling low, apart from all the fine times. Thank you for your everlasting support and motivation.
* My seniors Sidhharth sir, Jai sir, Pranjul sir, Shreya maam, Pranav sir, Asad sir and Anil sir, thank you for the valuable guidance and advise you have given to make the college life so easy and interesting.
* And finally all my juniors from my PG, my SIAM team, and all those in touch with me for their continuous support and encouragement.

And the friends who I haven't mentioned here, you all are just as important to me. A very hearty congratulations to all those who are selected along with me, especially Armaan Kohli and Vanshree Garg who are from my batch only. And a special thanks to the RBS team for giving us this opportunity!

> Dear Lord, if this is a dream... Please don't wake me up!
