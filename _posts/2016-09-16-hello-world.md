Hello everyone! Just dropped by to say hi and thank you for checking out my blog. This is my first blogpost and is going to be an introductory one. So please cut me some slack, for any mistakes that I may make in this or few of the upcoming posts.

So friends, I hope you all are doing good and very happy with your lives. And if you aren't, I wish the same happen to you very soon. But no matter what, it seems like you have nothing else to do. I mean you guys have time to even check out an introductory post like this (lulz). God help you poor souls! Though I don't believe in God as much as I don't believe in unicorns and yetis, but lets save this topic for some other time.

I had been planning to start this blog for quite some time now, but due to various reasons (or excuses as some might call it), I couldn't do it. Now having set up this blog, I am now wondering what to write about. Hence, a simple introductory post.

This blog is going to be about my views, experiences and projects. Most of the things would be technical stuff, as I like to work with different technologies and topics in computer science. But in addition to that, there will be some non-technical stuff as well (just to engage more crowd) which I haven't yet thought of üòù. But I'll try to keep the technical stuff as interesting.

Okay for now, I need a favour from you all. Currently my site is hosted on Github via github-pages, as is evident from the site's URL. I want a different domain name for this blog. Thus, I want you all to suggest some domain names in the comments section below. Check out the availability of a domain name using [this](https://www.namecheap.com/domains.aspx) link. Please consider the following points before suggesting:

* **MUST** have `.me` extension
* Easy to remember
* Should be less prone to spelling errors (otherwise amanagrawal.me is available :P)
* Either relate to Science and Technology, or it can be completely abstract.

Thank you all for taking your time out to read this post and I hope you'll continue to do it in future as well. Please do provide your valuable feedback in the comments section below. Have a good day üòâ
